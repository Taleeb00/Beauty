                                    of being the place to get amazing nails
                                    . We wouldnâ€™t be the studio that we are now, if not for the amazing nail artists
                                    that work with us.
                                    We have three types of artists at our nail art studio: Junior, House or Advanced
                                    nail artists.

                                    working at at our studio.
                                    They help us grow as a studio by sharing their knowledge and encouraging our nail
                                    artists to learn from each other.
                                    We are all about nails and pedicures but offer other beauty services to our guests.
